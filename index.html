            <p class="sec2tag">National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra (NIT Kurukshetra or NITKKR) is a public
                technical and research university located in Kurukshetra. In December 2008, it was accredited with the
                status of Institute of National Importance (INI). It
                is one of the 30 National Institutes of Technology established and administered by Government of
                India.It runs undergraduate and postgraduate in programme Engineering and Doctor of Philosophy programme
                in Engineering, Sciences and Humanities.
                <br>The first Prime Minister of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, sought to develop India as a leader
                in science and technology. Between 1959 and 1965, with this vision, the Government founded 14
                educational institutions in different
                regions of India. The system of competitive entry (based on merit) gave access to higher education in
                these institutions. Such an institution was established in 1963 in Kurukshetra as a joint enterprise of
                the Government of India and the
                Government of Punjab, India as the Regional Engineering College, Kurukshetra (REC Kurukshetra). In 2002,
                all the Regional Engineering Colleges were unified by a common entrance exam. Therefore, REC Kurukshetra
                was renamed to National Institute
                of Technology under the NIT Act and was given a Deemed University status.

                The campus extends over an area of 300 acres imaginatively laid down on a picturesque landscape. It
                presents a spectacle of harmony in architecture and natural beauty. The campus has been organised into
                three functional sectors: Hostels for the students,
                Instructional buildings and Residential sector for the staff. Hostels for students are located towards
                Eastern side of the campus in the form of cluster. Three storey buildings of hostels provide comfortable
                accommodation and pleasing
                environment to students. The instructional buildings have been located between the two residential
                sectors in order to reduce walking distance. A full fledged health centre manned by qualified doctors, a
                Post Office and a branch of the
                State Bank of India are located at convenient points on the Campus.

                As per establishment of the REC now known as NIT, Kurukshetra the entire Non-plan expenditure on
                Undergraduate Courses was borne by the central and State Government on 50:50 basis. This practice
                remained intact upto 31.3.2003 Consequent upon conversion
                of REC to NIT by the Government of India has taken over full administrative and financial control and
                the Central Government has started bearing the expenditure on Undergraduate Courses on 100% basis.
