            <dd class="dd">The Department of Civil Engineering of National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra
                (Formerly Regional Engineering College, Haryana) started functioning from the year 1963, when the first
                batch of students were admitted to the five year B
                Sc. Engineering Degree Course. In 1966, M Sc. Engineering Degree Courses in the specializations of
                Structural Engineering and Constructional Techniques; and Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering were
                started. The first registration
                for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Civil Engineering was done in 1967. The Institute switched
                over to four year B Tech Degree Programme from 1985. The M Sc Engineering programs were also renamed as
                M Tech programs. In 1989, M Tech
                Degree Course in Water Resources Engineering was started. Three Year Special Degree Course, “Bachelor of
                Engineering” for In-Service field engineers holding Diploma in Engineering was introduced from the
                Session 1982-83. The course was
                fully funded by Govt. of Haryana. The Govt. of Haryana has discontinued this course w.e.f 2001-02.
                Master of Technology in the specializations, Transportation Engineering and Environmental Engineering
                were started from year 2005.</dd>

            <dd class="dd">The branch of Electronics and Communication Engineering was started in the year 1971 under
                the aegis of Electrical Engineering Department. The “Department of Electronics and Communication
                Engineering” came into existence in the year 1973.
                In 1987, Computer Engineering branch was also started and the department was renamed as “Electronics,
                Communication and Computer Engineering”. In 2003, the department was again renamed as “Electronics and
                Communication Engineering” because
                of inception of “Computer Engineering Department” separately. The department started M.Tech. program in
                ECE and VLSI design in the year of 1987 and 2007, respectively. Presently, M.Tech. (VLSI Design) is
                being offered by the School of
                VLSI Design and Embedded Systems independently.</dd>
